Budgeting and Expenses for me, by me

1. Add all of your planned expenses. Everything. From your daily coffee to the new TV.
2. Track all the money you spend. It would be nice if we didn't have to do this, but we do, so do it.
3. Get all the insights:

  - If you're over/under-spending
  - How much unallocated income you have
  - More?
